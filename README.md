# Nonparametric analysis of 2020 US presidential elections

This is the repository for the project of *Nonparametric Statistics* course held at Politecnico di Milano during academic year 2020/2021. The aim of this work is to give an insight on 2020 US presidential election, in particular in understanding which factors may have infuenced the election.

A first part of the analysis is devoted to making some preliminary inference on different socio-economic and demographic factors at our disposal. We then focus on the fitting of a GAM prediction model using a part of our data as training set. We will compare it with respect to other possible models through a validation set, and, in the end, we will evaluate its predictive performances through the remaining observations, used as test set.

## Repository structure
The code is strucured as follows:
- `/data`: folder containing all the data used for the analysis
- `/code`: folder containing the codes for the analysis, further divided into:
    - `/data clean`: codes for cleaning and merging data-sets
    - `/Inference`: codes for the Inference part, on county level
    - `/Model`: codes for prediction part: GAM, SVM, Random Forest
    - `/Nations`: codes for the Inference part, on state level
    - `install.R`: file that provides automatic installation of required R packages
- `/Pics`: folder containing most of the pics present in the report
- `Ajroldi-Lurani-Marchionni.pdf`: report for the analysis

### Installation
The file `install.R` provides automatic installation of the required packages.
